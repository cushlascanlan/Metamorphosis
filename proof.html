[How it happens is this and if you think I’m lying, just know I’m a writer and writers and liars are basically the same thing.

I try to have sex and it hurts.

I try again and again and again and again and this time it hurts so much I turn into a crab. 

It's evolution, see. 

Metamorphosis. 

So I decide I’m going to stop. 

I decide it's fine to be alone forever. 

I start to self-harm on top of all the other things that hurt. 
See if I can just cut myself down to some nibble sized pieces, rearrange my fragments and make that floor a little looser and my thighs a little smaller maybe then someone will love me. 

(align:"==&gt;")+(box:"=========XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX=")[But of course, they won't.]

Because I'm a crusty, crusty, crustacean.

Because I'm sexually impotent.

Because I am //so//O//O//oO//oO//Oooooo//O//OOoo//oOO//oOoOO//OOOO//Ooo//o//Oo unloveable. 


And then,

I think, 

fuck it.

Maybe I can still have fulfilling sexual experiences without penetration.

Maybe I won’t have to be alone. 

Maybe I should have a //lot// more faith in men.


So I go on dates again.


I fuck in different ways 
and with different people
and without penetration

and then after fucking too much I think I get an STI. 

So I go to get it checked out

and it’s not, for the record. 

Instead I get diagnosed with what I should have been diagnosed with when I was nineteen or maybe eighteen or maybe sixteen, or maybe really fourteen,

and what I wish I could tell you is that this diagnosis split my shell //open//, 
and I became as exposed and raw and soft as a scallop or the back of a newborn’s head, 
all neonatal and shit 

##//finally// 

ready to face the idea of commitment and self-love. 

//Oh how beautiful//

//Oh how poetic //

You'd cry,
left with such a burning sense of poignancy and motivation 
to go out and live a life so passionate,
so fulfilling,
it burst forth from you in long and blissful colour-coated stretches.

I have a friend who was trying to divulge a traumatic memory to me about her father and every time she tried to tell the story, most of which I already knew from when were drunk one time off too many martinis, her tongue shrunk and  swelled and she stuttered and stammered and sat there mute for long periods of time.

I don’t know why this is so hard for me to get out, she’d muttered.

And as I looked up at her I said, I understand.

Not because I thought she'd appreciate it, but because I genuinely did.

In my first therapy session after my vaginismus diagnosis, my tongue decided to backflip and cartwheel and tumble-turn between my teeth and with watering eyes I could only move my head when the therapist asked who I had told about this and then, after that initial shake, she said, 
No one? So you’ve been alone with this for the entire time?

And as I cried I’d apologised and tried to say, it’s not so much sadness, I’m just angry.

Most bruises begin with a bump to the body and it isn’t until much later we notice the mould-coloured evidence of that initial hurt.

During a metamorphosis however, the body //becomes// the bruise. 

The pain begins, 
deep inside, 
not necessarily a stinging, 
but a pulsing, 
a blossoming,
above all, a repelling. 

A rejection. 

It starts gently; 
veins swell slowly, singing, expanding, a chorus of webbed voices, 
bones cracking, splintering, threading themselves back together from outside your skin. 
The most uncomfortable is the shifting of your internal organs, more so the way the mouth, the oesophagus, the linings of the stomach, rearrange and twist into new contortions. 

The debilitating ache of a period cramp is vaguely reminiscent of the bruising; 
that same nausea nestles itself in the tight space between your lungs, 
leaving your breath to rip its way out through the bars of your ribs 
and after those brief minutes have stretched on for what feels like hours, 
you are finally left, blood, spittle and teeth bites on lips, 
a shell of your former self.

And yet, when he finishes, my body’s left crumpled, suffocating beneath my skin, everything so wrong, so erroneous. 
I turn away from him to sleep, pretending to be nonchalant. 
Oh, shut up. I’m// NOT //crying. 

Surreptitiously, I check for blood between my thighs and when I see there’s nothing there, I close my eyes and will for sleep, trembling and soft. 
He curls himself against my back, soft little feather and the touch alone makes me sick to my knees, his arms, like two long blades, press deep into my back.

I must have finally fallen asleep because the pain echoes back through my body so badly my eyes open to darkness, my ears feel wet and full. 
I’m not in my own home so from the deep pit of my stomach the panic begins to pile and clamber up on top of itself until it’s sitting dry and furious at the back of my throat. ]
You’re overreacting, I tell myself, my thoughts so loud in the dark I question whether I’ve accidentally spoken them. 
I touch my ears and try to scoop the water out with my fingers but there is so much, 
even as I get up and stand next to the sleeping figure, 
head upright, 
the fluid doesn’t seem to stop.

I check my phone from where it lies and it reads 3:34am.

Making sure he’s still asleep, I wobble to the bathroom, 
tenderly shut the door and turn on the light. 

Above the sink behind the toothpaste spots, my mirrored eyes are dark. 
Blood, on both sides, drips down my head and onto my cheeks. 

Something is so deeply, intrinsically wrong. 

When I was a child, I called this feeling ‘The Fear’. 

Eyes unblinking, 
watering; 
I note the tears of skin that have ripped off my body, dripping from my new self like off-season petals.

It takes me a while for me to see myself for what I am. 

My body is so deeply hurt even the touch of clothes on my skin makes me nauseous. 
I remove them, 
then the skin ribbons; 
stand naked and quiet under the yellow light, 
lock the door for good measure 
and look down at myself. 


(align:"=&gt;&lt;=")+(box:"===XXXXXXXXXXXXXX===")[ [[There are no more scars on my skin-&gt;Zoea 1]]. 

There’s not much skin left on my body at all. 

Everything seems to have gone but the skin on my chest.]

Looking down further, I spot my two old human feet stuck like thumbtacks against a couple of lean, amber legs and choke on a laugh. 

//What the fuck is this?//

I go to touch my face but I realise I can’t; 
lifting my arms anywhere higher than my thick torso feels like they’re being ripped out of their sockets.

I think back to Helene Cixous, who argues that Écriture Féminine must be written from the body.















But my body is broken.

It is not a part of me.

I have rejected it.

The laughter turns to terror. 

All I can think to do is scream.

Eyes wide, breath held, slowly, silently, I twist my eyes to survey the rest of my body. 

A thick orange thorax; ten pointed legs, two with bladed claws. 


(align:"=&gt;&lt;=")+(box:"===XXXXXXXXXXXXXX===")[//Oh my God, I’m a fucking crab.//]

Without a trace of hesitation, I return my clothes to my body, 
pick up my skin; 
turn off the light and open the door. 

He’s still asleep, facing away from the hollow concave where my human body once lay. 

I have an urge to hold a funeral for myself, trace the lines of my old frame and cry for the future I was meant to have—boyfriends, casual sex, casually talking about sex. 

//So it is all me. I am a freak.//

The moon drips into a cold stain on the bedroom floor and in its dim light I squint to collect my belongings from where they’ve been scattered; 
my socks, shoes, jacket, phone, bag. 

Without bothering to put anything else on,

I leave to wait under a cold copper streetlight two blocks away from his house for 
my uber to come, 

telling myself I’ll message him when the sun’s up, 

and knowing I won’t.

[[I go to get a mammogram-&gt;Biopsy]]. There’s a lump in my left breast. 

The doctor tells me I shouldn’t worry, that I’m in the wrong age bracket to be especially concerned. 

I am not relieved. 

At one point I sit in the Imaging Service Clinic in a cold hallway with nothing but a modesty gown, the artificial lights rubbing against my bare skin like cool rubber gloves. 
The lighting and blue tiles make me feel like I’m in an aquarium. 
I suppose I should be in a fish tank.

To pass the time I let my hypochondria tango away with my thoughts and tap my ten legs against the blue lino-ground in succession.

My hypochondria salsas with the idea of a mastectomy. 

Even if the lump is benign, there’s a chance it could become cancerous and wouldn’t it be safer to cut off my breast now? 
And then, what’s the point of only having one breast?

I think about the politics of losing my breasts and it’s then that I become even more aware of my shell. 

I look down at my body and see it as what it is; 
utterly sexless in form, in utility.

It’s not the end of my world to lose both my breasts. 
I’ve become so utterly disconnected from my body that anyone that touches me now only touches shell, anyway.

I try to imagine a future relationship with someone. 
It’s our first date, 
we’re sipping drinks. 

“Just a forewarning, I have no breasts. And I can’t have penetrative sex. And in my early twenties I finally metamorphosed into a crab. But what’s that thing they say about personality?”

Radio silence from my dream date.

Tough crowd.

“Cushla?”

I look up, bundle my shirt and jacket onto my hip like a small child, and follow the nurse into the ultrasound room.

I hadn’t thought about children.

As I lay down against the bed, lifting my arm up above my head, brazen with [[my scars-&gt;Zoea 1]], I think a lot about what it is exactly that makes a woman.

“On a scale of one to ten, let me know how much it hurts. I’m usually happy to keep going at a one-to-two pain level, but anything more and we will definitely stop, okay?”

I am careful to leave my shoes on, which she finds strange, but I don’t care. 
Beneath my shoes are the remainder of my [[two feet-&gt;Eggs]]; the rest of my legs dangle precariously off the edge of the bed like a patulous silk fan.

I read somewhere about (link: "how women are more likely to minimise their pain:") 
[(font: "arial narrow")[

//She pointed out that some women tolerate pain with sex “just because they have this belief that, ‘I guess some pain is to be expected’.”
She went on, “There’s something about women bearing pain longer than they need to,” perhaps in other domains of their life, as well as in sex. They tolerate pain because they think that is their only option, that effective treatments aren’t available (they are!), or that the hassle of seeking treatment isn’t worth the potential benefit (it is!). And medical professionals sometimes reinforce this tendency by not taking pain seriously or assuming that if there is no infection or injury, the pain is “all in her head.” // 
Come As You Are, Emily Nagoski, p. 321 ]]
 
and it seems funny to me to look back and see how I describe the initial pain as less than one, "Like three -quarters of one," I say.

As she moves in further I say, "Yep, that’s like a one." 
And she says, “Okay, I’m going to say that’s a two, and your first lot of pain was a one. Do you want to continue?” 

And I reply yes, because all I want to know is what’s wrong with me.

She feels around further and we come to discover [[the left side of my vaginal wall is more sensitive than the right.-&gt;How A Vulva Works]]

I make a list of the internal organs on that side to try and find [[Meaning-&gt;Meaning]]. 

There’s your stomach, your spleen, your heart. 
It seems poetic enough.

“Okay good, now can you squeeze for me? And let go. Now squeeze for me? Now let go. How did you feel with those?”

And I say, “I think I’m fine with the squeezing bit.”

And she says, “I think so too. I think your trouble is [[letting go.-&gt;Letting Go]]”

And I want to laugh and say, 
that’s pretty perceptive for a physio, 
but there’s a time and a place 
and I’m sure she’d heard it all before.

After the exam I am given a tapered glass dilator that I am told to warm up and insert inside of me four to five times a week with some sort of lube- preferably something natural- and do the pelvic exercises. 
It can take as little as 8 weeks to get better. 
I am giddy and hopeful and optimistic for the first time in years. I start thinking about what life would be like without the weight of this pressing into my back, the internal anguish, the despair I turn back so cruelly onto myself.

During the pandemic, the feeling of isolation has become second nature to most of Australia’s population. 
Statistics surrounding loneliness and non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) are indisputably linked.

Isolation is a breeding ground for the addictive behaviour of self-harm and NSSI is incredibly cyclical. 
People harm when they feel alone, the action makes them feel more isolated, they continue to harm.

[[Before my diagnosis-&gt;Scared]], when it came to dating, I’d ultimatum-ed myself with two options.

(link: "1.")[1. Keep things completely casual and cut them off before they cut you off
(Because once they realised we would not being have penetrative sex, they //would// cut me off.)]

(link: "2.")[2. Be alone forever.]

When Lockdown 6.0 is announced, my internal isolation echoes into reality. 
I go to harm and my skin ruptures. 
Driven back into my self, for a split second I look up to meet my frightened eyes in the mirror, all silent witness to that sad dog mouth and those slobbering, colourless cheeks and I begin to cry, terrified.
I check myself, my breath, my skin and beneath the wound all there is is a lively poppy-red singe, the colour of a fresh-boiled lobster. 

The denser skin, the thick scars where I’d thought to hurt myself in the same place to lessen the coverage of my sores, is raw and orange, the touch and feel of a soft-shelled crab.

Fingers hooked, I trace the outlines with a shiver and think a lot about evolution and how we evolve to survive.

Afterwards, when I'm done, I put on my headphones and run a hot bath to distract myself from the pain and pretend to be Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman. 
The B52’s plays and I think of my Mum, 
of Rock Lobsters 
and of my own crab skeleton, 
as the remaining band of skin around my chest splits; the last of my fire-engine red shell mutating out from under my skin like the blooming of a wet, blood-soaked bud.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="16" name="Biopsy" tags="" position="634,511" size="100,100">(enchant:?page,(text-colour:black)+(background:white))




I have to get a biopsy for the [[breast lump-&gt;Zoea 4]]. 

I’m wearing a fitted black tube top that I bought when I was seventeen. It’s stretchy and slips down my chest when I’m in a hurry. 
Whenever I become self-conscious, I tug it up so that the folds of the fabric roll up into my arm pits. 
After this doctor’s appointment though, I’m feeling insolent. 
I don’t care who looks at me. 
I cry into my face mask because I’m still waltzing with the notion that given the state of my body, no one will ever want to pursue me romantically. 

- too broken, 

- too crabby, 

- too scarred, 

- too sexless. 

It is a self-indulgent hurt, the kind that almost feels nice in its ache, like pressing on a loose tooth.

I clamber up the stairs of the tram and sit down and my tube top slips a little lower than it should and the man opposite me stares at my chest.

I don’t want to draw any more attention to myself and for some reason I don’t want to acknowledge him staring, so I hunch my shoulders the smallest bit and look out the window and slip into my shell, pretending I don’t even have breasts.

(link: "When I was fourteen a man catcalled me from a car window as I walked to school.") [
It was a mufti-day and I was wearing a black singlet, my hair up in a little ballet bun. 

The car slowed down, enough time for the front passenger to call out, 

"You have a pair of exceptional breasts." 

For some reason that was worse to me than a whistle, 
than a 
‘nice tits, love’, 
which was something myself and most of the teenage girls in the derogatory town I grew up in were used to, 
and something that could be easily laughed off. 

For some reason it really got to me.

I did the thing I always do when I’m humiliated and anxious. 
I let my eyes sink into the back of my skull and tunnel-visioned, holding my breath until my body began to float, vision blurring black. 
When I reached school, I immediately went to Lost Property and wore a sports jumper for the rest of the 27-degree day,
rolling the blue fleece up to the sweaty crease of my elbows.

Solidified in that encounter was this notion I think I have always harboured, 
that my body is not my own.
My body is something sexual and I have no choice in how it is perceived, touched or viewed.]

(align:"&lt;==")+(box:"=========XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX=")[//“I don’t remember the first time I tried to have sex. I don’t remember the second, third or fourth times either. The times after that are a faceless blur, a mess of pain, distress and self-loathing.

The Space Between, Michelle Andrews &amp; Zara McDonald, p.158]

(link:" When I was sixteen or so, I began to wear my dad’s large shirts.")[ 
I still think it looks cute,
but back then my favourite part was how it would swamp my body; 
four androgynous and dangling limbs sticking out of such loose fabric made me feel so small, so indistinguishable. 

Without breasts, hips, without my body, I felt safe enough to be seen. 

And later, when I finally felt invisible enough to mentally control my own sexuality, it was my physical body that seized up.]


(align:"&lt;==")+(box:"=========XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX=")[//“ I would have begrudged reading that my body started to heal the minute I began to forgive it. I would have struggled to accept that sex stopped being painful when I stopped feeling so much shame about it, or when I finally had the words to talk about it...But...I can only tell you that vaginismus loosened its clutches on my mind when I started to let people in, when I refused to feel shame.” //
The Space Between, Michelle Andrews &amp; Zara McDonald, p.167]

The man on the tram gets off two stops before me. 

I find I’ve been holding my breath. 

I suck in a lungful and let it out, slowly, adjust my top, [[wrap my jacket-&gt;Letting Go]] around my body and lean back more comfortably, setting my sight on the people outside the tram’s window.

[The only real thing that stressed me out about anal isn’t the penetration, ([[I deal with pain regardless-&gt;Eggs]]), it’s the douching.
And the after-sex shits. 
Maybe in the gay community this is less of a taboo. 
Or maybe they’re all just more familiar with it.
I couldn’t imagine a straight cis guy finally trying anal for the first time and being happy if his dick pulled out with his girlfriends digested breakfast. 

Like I genuinely can’t even //begin// to imagine the conversation. 

Sex is lowkey gross and grotty and filled with gas and fluids and spit and embarrassment and most consider that part of the intimacy- but even my parents, married for thirty years, still shit with the door closed. 

There’s that line too, 
that boundary that anal crosses with strangers. 

When you meet someone for the first time and after thirty minutes it’s still not working so you say, //we can try anal//, almost (mouseover-replace:"almost")[okay, so a little] desperately, the guys are usually somewhat reserved, distrustful and then when they see you’re serious, they’re literally more ecstatic than they were when they realised they would get to have sex with you in the first place and I don't really know your position on the subject, but I find it such a turnoff.

In the midst of my metamorphosis I’ve been reading this essay and it talks about Marie Darrieussecq’s ‘Pig Tales’ and how when the protagonist turns into her pig self, her clients at the brothel are enamoured by it and end up crawling around on all fours themselves and fucking ‘like animals’. 

It’s a ‘satirical take on gender roles’, but I find that phrasing in itself to be satirical.

[[“Do you think it’s a question of sexuality? Maybe you’re just not interested in men.”-&gt;Vaginismus]]

And when I read stories of men behaving like pigs and when I meet [[men who behave like pigs-&gt;Biopsy]],

I wish that this were 100% true. 

But it is not a question of sexual attraction or emotional attachment.

(link: "SHAME") [“Medieval anatomists called women’s external genitals the 'pudendum', a word derived from the Latin // pudere //, meaning 'to make ashamed.' Our genitals were thus named 'from the shamefacedness that is in women to have them seen.
The reasoning went like this: Women’s genitals are tucked away between their legs, as if they wanted to be hidden, whereas male genitals face forward...And why would men’s and women’s genitals be different in this way? If you’re a medieval anatomist, steeped in a sexual ethic of purity, it’s because: [[shame-&gt;Biopsy]].” 
p.17 ]


(link: "HYMENS") [
“The [[hymen-&gt;Bleeding Between Periods]] is a profound example of the way humans [[metaphorize anatomy-&gt;Scared]]. Here is an organ that has no biological function, and yet Western culture made up a powerful story about he hymen a long time ago. This story has nothing to do with biology and everything to do with controlling women. Culture saw a ‘barrier’ at the mouth of the vagina and decided it was a marker of ‘virginity’...Such a weird idea could have been invented only in a society where women were literally property, their vaginas their most valuable real estate—a gated community.”
p.28-29] 


(link: "PAIN") [
“[[The closest thing to true is that during intercourse the hymen can be painful if it’s not used to being stretched-&gt;Vaginismus]]—that’s one of a number of potential causes of pain with penetration, but it is by no means the most common. (The most common is lack of lubrication.)
But the hymen doesn’t break and stay broken forever, like some kind of freshness seal. If a hymen tears or bruises, it heals. And the size of a hymen doesn’t vary depending on whether the vagina has been penetrated. Also, it usually doesn’t bleed. Any blood with first penetration is more likely due to general vaginal tearing from lack of lubrication than to damage to the hymen. 
Women’s hymens vary because, as far as science has been able to discover, the hymen was not selected for by evolution. It has no reproductive or any other function.

Liars.

I am hideously exhausted when I talk to people because I don’t just talk and listen anymore, instead one eye stalk stares out at the people I’m conversing with, while my other eye cranes round in a 180 to peer down at my thick red shell body; making me feel so utterly disconnected and apart from my self and those around me that all I can imagine doing is ripping my eyes from their sockets and sleeping for the rest of eternity.

I type into google, ‘Why do people metamorphose?’

It’s been years, but I’m finally trying to explain it.

“It’s like there’s this wall,” I tell my therapist. 
I know I can’t even begin to explain what being a crustacean is like,


(align:"&lt;==&gt;")+(box:"=======XXXXXX=======")[“This glass wall between me and everyone I know. 
And I try to connect, but I’m behind it. 
I can see you and you can see me, 
but we just-- 
I just can’t connect. 
So much of the time, 
it feels like I’m not connecting, 
like I’m not really there, 
like I’m just looking down on things.”]

I don’t mention my eye stalks.


I remember being drunk one time and having a discussion with a friend about how I’m never really certain the world is real. 

How I’m almost always waiting for the day 
where I’ll just slip through something— 
I’ll be walking down the street and suddenly the pavement will swell and loosen, 
and I’ll sink right in, 
with just enough time for that single moment of clarity,

(align:"=&gt;&lt;=")[“So, it was all for nothing.”] 

People often talk about the performative nature of sex, 
but for me, 
the act is in living itself. 

The physicality of sex just makes me more aware of the disconnect. 

I look at people for too long and make them uncomfortable.

I touch them, 
not necessarily in a sexual way, 
in a way of reassurance. 

When I wake up in the morning, I am never certain they’ll be there. 

I blame my shell. 
I blame the dyspareunia. 
[[The vaginismus. -&gt;Causes]]

I say, "I evolved too soon. Carcinisation is taking too long for the rest of you. 
No, sorry that was mean, it’s not you, it really is me.

I touch people unnecessarily when I am drunk. 
I lean my hands on knees, 
tap people’s arms, 
try to connect,
make sure they’re there; 
make sure I’m there, too.

### ACTUAL CAUSES OF VAGINISMUS:

[- medical conditions such as recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs), yeast infections (thrush), chronic pain syndromes or endometriosis

- trauma associated with childbirth

- previous painful pelvic examinations

- previous painful or unpleasant sex

- negative stigmas and ideas surrounding sex (particularly for those brought up in religious environments associated with sexual repression)

- previous sexual assault or rape

- overstimulation of the pelvic floor due to over-exercise or bladder dysfunction


####Furthermore, there are 
###TWO TYPES OF VAGINISMUS: 

- Primary: when complete (painless) vaginal penetration has never been achieved
- Secondary: when penetration in the past has been achieved, but is no longer possible


Now here is a really  excellent site on (link: "Vaginismus:")[(goto-url: 'https://www.jeanhailes.org.au/health-a-z/sex-sexual-health/painful-sex-dyspareunia ')]


And just, //finally//, 

It really is easy to fix. 

I swear.

Don't wait for the [[metamorphosis-&gt;Passage Image]]. 

Tomorrow, sex //will// be good again.
